# JILL - Julia Installer 4 Linux - Light

Simply install latest [Julia](https://julialang.org).

On Linux, the best way to install Julia is to use the Generic Linux
Binaries. And while **all Linux users** love manually downloading,
unpacking, and linking their software, this script does it for you.

Simply run

    bash -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abelsiqueira/jill/master/jill.sh)"

If you want to avoid using sudo, create a folder, add it to your PATH
and then issue

    JULIA_INSTALL=yourfolder sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abelsiqueira/jill/master/jill.sh)"
